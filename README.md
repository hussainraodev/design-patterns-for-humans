Design patterns for humans in unity
Design patterns in Unity, just like in any other software development context, are reusable solutions to common problems. While many design patterns used in general software development can also be applied in Unity, there are some specific patterns that are commonly used when developing games or interactive experiences. Here are a few design patterns that can be useful when working with humans or character behaviors in Unity:

State Pattern:
The State pattern is helpful for managing complex character behaviors. It allows you to define different states for a character (such as idle, walking, running, attacking, etc.) and transitions between these states. Each state encapsulates its own behavior and can change the character's behavior based on certain conditions or triggers.

Observer Pattern: # Observer Pattern:
The Observer pattern is useful when you want different game objects or systems to react to events or changes in a character's state. For example, you might have an enemy AI that needs to react to a player's actions. The character or player can be the subject, and the observers can be the enemy AI systems that respond to the character's actions.

Command Pattern:
The Command pattern is useful when you want to decouple the execution of actions from the objects that invoke them. In the context of character behaviors, this pattern can be used to create reusable and interchangeable commands. For example, you can have commands for actions like attacking, jumping, or interacting with objects, and these commands can be executed by different characters or triggered by different input sources.

Strategy Pattern:
The Strategy pattern allows you to define interchangeable algorithms or behaviors and dynamically switch between them at runtime. In the context of character behaviors, you can use this pattern to define different strategies for enemy AI, such as aggressive, defensive, or evasive behaviors. These strategies can be selected or switched based on the game's conditions or player interactions.

Component-Based Pattern:
Unity's component-based architecture lends itself well to a component-based design pattern. Instead of creating monolithic character scripts, you can decompose character behaviors into individual components, such as movement, animation, input, etc. This pattern promotes reusability, modularity, and makes it easier to extend or modify character behaviors.

These are just a few examples of design patterns that can be applied to human or character behaviors in Unity. The choice of pattern depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your game or application. It's important to note that design patterns are tools and should be used judiciously based on the needs of your project.
